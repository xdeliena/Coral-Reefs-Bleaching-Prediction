🌊 Coral Reef Bleaching Prediction Using Machine Learning

Hi! I’m Deliena Tasha Binti Abdul Rahim, and this repository contains my bachelor's degree final year thesis project focused on predicting coral reef bleaching using machine learning.

The project aims to analyze environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) to predict bleaching events and support early conservation efforts. Multiple machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and LSTM. 🪸⚠️

The tools used in this project include Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost, and Weka. This thesis demonstrates how data-driven and AI-based approaches can be applied to real-world environmental problems, particularly in coral reef monitoring and protection.
